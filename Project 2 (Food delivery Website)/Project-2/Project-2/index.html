                <p class="center">
                    Food catering is always an essential ingredient for any party, corporate event, wedding event,
                    family reunions or baby showers. When your guests attend your event, they will expect to be served
                    with delicious and good food.
                    When you are organizing an event, a professional catering company can be a great assistant to you.
                    They can be so helpful that they will be able to take some stress off you. Although catering has a
                    basic idea which is to cook some food and serve it, actually there is more to it. Now, let me share
                    with you some simple tips so that you are more prepared and make sure that the catering company can
                    execute your plan successfully:
                    1.Finalize your location, date and time for your event. These are some of the most important things
                    that you must finalize before hiring a catering company. Sometimes, a catering service may be
                    available on site. This is good because they will be very familiar with the ground, layout and
                    coordination. If you are bringing in a catering company, make sure that they are briefed on the
                    location, date and time of your event.
                    2.Set your budget for catering service. Before you set the budget for catering, you need to ask
                    yourself how important the roles of food and drink will play at your event. How many guests are you
                    inviting to your event? Are you having a buffet or a sit-down dinner? Do you need to have a theme or
                    style for your event that will be reflected in the food that you served? All these are some
                    questions that you need to clarify first. Sometimes the cost of the catering service also depends on
                    the caterer's level of expertise and reputation.
                    3.Find out whether they provide catering staffs. Some catering service will provide staffs and
                    servers. Find out from them how many staffs they are providing for your event. A general rule of
                    thumb is to have 1 server for every 10 guests. You can also request the dress code of the staffs in
                    accordance with the dress attire of your guests and the theme of your event.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Bulk Orders means (a) orders for large volumes of Product Units from a single customer
                    where the Commercialization Partner or its designated Distributor or Distributor Affiliates requests
                    Supplier to participate in the sale, and (b) proposed sales of large volumes to governmental health
                    agencies where the agency requires or requests that Supplier submit or work with Commercialization
                    Partner or its designated Distributor or Distributor Affiliates to submit a proposal in connection
                    with a tender offer. In such cases, Commercialization Partner and Supplier shall work together
                    jointly to prepare the proposal for a Bulk Order, including special pricing by Supplier to the
                    customer, which shall be submitted by Supplier or by Commercialization Partner or its designated
                    Distributor or Distributor Affiliates on behalf of Supplier. Upon the successful award of such
                    purchase orders or tenders Commercialization Partner or its designated Distributor or Distributor
                    Affiliates and Supplier shall cooperate to provide the Products and services required by the agency.
                    In connection with Bulk Orders Supplier shall provide the Products to the purchaser through
                    Commercialization Partner or its designated Distributor or Distributor Affiliates, but
                    Commercialization Partner or its designated Distributor or Distributor Affiliates shall not be
                    required to purchase the Products from Supplier.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Food Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Online food ordering could be called the response of the Internet to the desire for
                    delivery food. It is a growing trend especially in urban areas and on college campuses that allows
                    people to order from restaurants featuring interactive menus, by use of their Internet connection.
                    In many cases, any Internet capable device that can handle complicated web pages can be used to make
                    orders, though a lot of people rely on a desktop or laptop computer for this. A second definition of
                    online food ordering is that it is ordering from grocery stores to stock the kitchen, instead of
                    placing one time orders with a restaurant.There are several ways in which online food ordering from
                    a restaurant may occur. A restaurant can have its own website with easy features for placing an
                    order for pick-up or delivery. Some add a third option of being able to make reservations. Instead
                    of calling for a delivery, people just access the Internet, head to the restaurant site and make
                    their order.Alternately, one online food ordering site may feature the menus of many different
                    restaurants. This way, customers can browse through the menus, weighing thing like preference, cost,
                    and others, and determine what they want to order. Two things can occur here: the online site may
                    offer food delivery and pick up food ordered from the restaurant, usually assessing some form of
                    delivery fee, or it may deliver the order via Internet or phone to the chosen restaurant, which then
                    prepares and delivers the food. The latter scenario is more likely, but there are food delivery
                    services that specialize in picking up from any participating restaurant.</p>
